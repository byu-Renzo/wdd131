    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>The primary purpose of this website is to create a comprehensive repository of all the courses I have taken at
      BYU-Idaho. This platform is designed to be a valuable resource for my own learning journey and to support my
      classmates in their educational endeavors. By meticulously documenting each assignment and project I complete,
      this repository will offer concrete examples, creative solutions, and supplementary resources such as videos,
      blogs, and GitHub repositories. This will enhance the overall learning experience and foster a sense of
      collaboration within our community. Ultimately, the goal is to enrich the educational journey of all participants
      by sharing knowledge and supporting each other as we advance towards mastering web development.</p>

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What resources can I use to improve my learning in a course?</li>
      <li>How can I find examples of completed projects for my current course?</li>
      <li>How can I find additional resources to complement my course studies?</li>
      <li>What should I do to find motivation when I feel like I'm not learning the course lessons?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Colors</h2>

    <p> The color schema for the website will utilize colors that evoke a sense of innovation and learning. We will use
      a dark background color, #0B0C14, to minimize eye strain and provide a comfortable reading experience for
      students. For primary elements like headings, we will use #00b28f to create a striking contrast and highlight key
      information. Secondary elements such as subheadings will use #7de5e5 to complement the primary color and maintain
      visual harmony. Paragraphs and body text will be in #DDDDDD to ensure readability against the dark background.
      Accents and links will incorporate #9d96f6 to draw attention to important elements and foster an engaging learning
      environment.</p>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent</th>
        <th>Background</th>

        <td class="text">[#DDDDDD]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>
      The primary font for the website will be 'Nunito', a modern and versatile typeface that is easy to read and
      complements the overall design aesthetic. Additionally, we will use 'Croissant One' for headings where we want to
      highlight modern titles prominently. The font weight will be set to 400 for body text and 700 for headings to
      create a clear hierarchy and improve readability.
    </p>
